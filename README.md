## Version Control

Version control is simply the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

### Difference between Git and Github

Git is a version control system that allows developers track changes in their code, while github is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.

#### Alternatives to Github

- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- SourceForge

#### Difference between Git pull and Git fetch

The git pull command copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory while git fetch only copies changes into your local it repository.

#### Git rebase

git rebase is a simple command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another. It is used to maintain a clean project history by incorporating changes from one branch onto another without creating unnecessary merge commits.

The command is "git rebase branch-main"

#### Git cherry-pick

git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to apply a specific-commit from one branch to another. It's useful when you want to pick and choose individual commits to apply to a new branch without merging the entire branch.

The command is "git cherry-pick commit-hash"
